    "This notebook has the goal of testing MFA-models, and determining if it is a good model choice. \n",
    "The notebook aims to test:\n",
    "-   Model Complexity - Will the model be able to get a good BIC score and out-of-sample likelyhood\n",
    "-   Reconstruction Fidelity - Calculate the reconstruction error in RMSE and SAM (Spectral Angle Mapper)\n",
    "-   Interpretability - Does the components represent different and new signals\n",
    "-   Class Interpretability - Assign a colour to each FA, and map the Hyperspectral image next to its rgb-image, do we see the same structures?  "
